# Another Tiny Compiler

Welcome to Another Tiny Compiler! This project is a concise yet comprehensive example of a compiler, written in just about 120 lines of Python code. It's designed to be an engaging and hands-on introduction to compiler construction and programming languages.

## Features

* **Concise**: The entire compiler is implemented in approximately 120 lines of code. This makes it easy to read and understand, especially for those who are new to the field.

* **Hands-on Learning**: The compiler is designed to be a hands-on learning tool. It covers key concepts such as lexical analysis, parsing, and code generation. It's a great starting point for anyone interested in learning more about how compilers work.

* **Room for Improvement**: The compiler is intentionally left with room for improvement. This is to encourage learners to think critically about how they might optimize or extend the compiler. There are also some test cases missing, providing an opportunity to practice writing tests.

* **Inspired by Greatness**: This project is inspired by [the super tiny compiler for Python](https://github.com/josegomezr/the-super-tiny-compiler) and [the super tiny compiler](https://github.com/jamiebuilds/the-super-tiny-compiler). We stand on the shoulders of giants!
